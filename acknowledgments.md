Like most projects, the jme3-utilities project builds upon the work of many who have gone before. I therefore acknowledge the following software developers:

  * Cris (aka "t0neg0d") for creating SkyDome (which provided both an inspiration and a starting point for SkyControl) and also for encouraging me to run with it ... thank you yet again!
  * Paul Speed, for helpful insights which got me unstuck during debugging
  * the brave souls who volunteered to be alpha testers for SkyControl, including:
    * Davis Rollman
    * "Lockhead"
    * Jonatan Dahl
    * Mindaugas (aka "eraslt")
    * Thomas Kluge
    * "pixelapp"
    * Roger (aka "stenb")
  * the beta testers for SkyControl, including:
    * "madjack"
    * Benjamin D.

    * the FindBugs source code analyzer
    * Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program

Many of SkyControl's assets were based on the works of others who licensed their works under liberal terms or contributed it to the public domain.  For this I thank:
  * Cris (aka "t0neg0d")

  * Tom Ruen

I am grateful to Google Code for providing free hosting for the jme3-utilities project and many other open-source projects.

I'm also grateful to Julian (for lending me one of his microphones) and finally my dear Holly, for keeping me sane.

If I've misattributed anything or left anyone out, please let me know so I can correct the situation.
